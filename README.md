## Responsible Layout

Landing page has a mega menu and "Request a Demo", "Log in" and "Language" buttons. Those layout changes depending on the device width. I set 1280px and 780px as breakpoint.  
Other components changes as well. Also, to be improve loading page speed, All icons and images are converted into SVGs or Webp files.
